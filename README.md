***A Rails application to demonstrate several features of rails.***  
Blog-Jan is an introductory project aiming to teach the basic ruby-on-rails features on Campus Code bootcamp. Each student made its own version, implementing features they tough were important.  
In my version I used bootstrap to make it responsive, and allow authentication, so users can comment on posts, but only an admin can create or edit them.
This project is always active. As I learn new things, I implement them.

## Features
* **Blog Owner (or Admin) is the only one who can create, edit, or remove posts**
* **Visitor can view individual posts or all of them**
* **Visitor can authenticate to leave comments**
* **Bootstrap added for responsiveness**
* **Newer posts are shown on top**
* **Only Last 10 posts are shown on homepage**
* **Posts' texts on homepage have a limited length**
* **Posts have a subtitle**
* **Posts have a cover image**
* **Blog has an index with all posts organized by time**

## Future improvements
* **Posts will be formattable**
* **Posts will have tags**
* **Blog will have a search bar**
* **Blog will have share buttons**
* **Visitor will be able to login with facebook**
