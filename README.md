***A Rails application to demonstrate several features of rails.***  
Blog-Jan is an introductory project aiming to teach the basic ruby-on-rails features on Campus Code bootcamp. Each student made its own version, implementing features they tough were important. In my version I used bootstrap to make it responsive, and allow authentication, so users can comment on posts, but only an admin can create or edit them.
This project is always active. As I learn new things, I implement them.
****
